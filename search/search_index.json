For additional guidance, please refer to the Reloaded-II documentation. To build the mod, you will require the following components: Git .NET 5 SDK Visual Studio 2019+ (Recommended) Steps Clone this repository (and its submodules). git clone --recursive https://github.com/Sewer56/Riders.Tweakbox.git Add an environment variable named TWEAKBOX_DIR to your user variables. The value should be the location where the compiled mod is to be placed. I recommend using {LOCATION_OF_RELOADED_II}/Mods/riders.utils.tweakbox , such that when you build the project, the new version is immediately available in Reloaded-II. Open Riders.Tweakbox.sln in Visual Studio or your preferred editing environment of choice. Publishing Publishing builds this mod in an optimized format such that it is ready for end users to consume. Open a PowerShell prompt and navigate to the Riders.Tweakbox folder. Run the Publish script with .\\Publish.ps1 . This will automatically build the mod, make a folder called Publish and put a zipped compiled version of the mod there ready to be shared.","title":"Building"},{"location":"building/#building","text":"This is a summary.
